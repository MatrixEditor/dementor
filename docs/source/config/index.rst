Configuration
=============

Configuration can be tediousâ€”but it's also one of the most important aspects, and
good documentation makes all the difference. The sections listed below provide
detailed explanations for each configuration area.

Before diving into configuring *Dementor*, it's essential to understand the structure
of the configuration file. The configuration is written using the `TOML <https://toml.io/en/>`_
format. Make sure you're familiar with TOML's syntax and concepts to effectively work
with *Dementor*.
